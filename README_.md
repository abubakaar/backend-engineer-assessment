## Documentation for Temporal Java Spring Boot User Registration Project (Gradle)

This document outlines the setup, testing procedures, and implementation approach for the Spring Boot project utilizing Temporal to register users in both a database and Stripe.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or later
    * Gradle build tool
    * Temporal server running (local or remote)
2. **Clone the Project:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abubakaar/backend-engineer-assessment.git
    ```
3. **Configure Dependencies:**
    * Edit the `build.gradle` file located in the root of your project.
    * Add the necessary dependencies for Temporal Java SDK, Spring Boot, and your database and Stripe libraries.
    * Refer to the official documentation for these libraries to determine the appropriate versions.
  
5. **Stripe Configuration:**
    * Obtain your Stripe API keys and configure them in the `application.properties` file.

### Running Tests

1. **Unit Tests:**
    * The project should utilize a testing framework like JUnit or Mockito.
    * Unit tests should verify the functionality of individual components like database interactions and Stripe API calls.
    * Run tests from your IDE or command line using `gradle test`.

### Implementation Approach and Assumptions

* The project utilizes Temporal workflows to orchestrate user registration.
* A workflow likely defines the steps involved in registration, including:
    * User data validation
    * Database user creation
    * Stripe customer creation
* Activities are implemented to encapsulate logic for interacting with the database and Stripe API.
* **Assumptions:**
    * The database schema for storing user information is pre-defined.
    * A Stripe account with proper permissions is available.
* **Note:** Spring dependency injection might not be suitable for workflows due to their stateless nature. Consider alternative approaches for accessing configuration within workflows.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Document error handling strategies for potential failures during database or Stripe interactions.
* Specify retry logic for transient errors encountered during workflow execution.
* Consider implementing logging and monitoring for workflows and activities.

This documentation provides a starting point. You can expand on it by including specific code examples, diagrams illustrating the workflow execution, and best practices for Temporal development.
